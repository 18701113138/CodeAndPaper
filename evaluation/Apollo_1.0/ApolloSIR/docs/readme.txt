The Apollo Lunar Autopilot (Apollo) is a model created by an engineer from the Apollo Lunar Module digital autopilot team and included in the Java PathFinder distribution.  The program takes 6 double inputs from the console.  The main method for execution is located in rjc.RJCMain.java.
This SIR version adds assertions to the class "rjc.rjc.java".  These assertions are synthesized by Daikon using the iDiscovery technique as described in Zhang et al.'s ISSTA 2014 paper.  These assertions enable assertion-based verification techniques to apply to Apollo.  Note that the assertions require Daikon Version 4.6.4 to compile.
To execute the program simply invoke the main method in rjc.RJCMain.java and provide the 6 inputs as instructed by the program.
